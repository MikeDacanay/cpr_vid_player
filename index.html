            <h1 class="width-80 tablet-width-100">The World’s Most Intelligent Database Just Got Smarter</h1>
            <p>Long the stuff of self-aware robots and other speculative science fiction
                scenarios, artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the mainstream. Today’s
                adaptive intelligent systems bring a high degree of automation to everyday
                activities—from self-driving cars to self-aware firewalls that identify hackers
                before they can breach your network. The most advanced AI systems use
                machine learning algorithms to analyze current conditions and learn from
                experience, getting progressively smarter over time. They rely on analytics
                to discover pertinent patterns in immense volumes of data, yielding insights
                that were formerly only accessible to highly trained data scientists.</p>
            <p>As machine learning systems get more capable, they are entering
                every corner of the information technology (IT) industry. The biggest
                development—the one that stands to change nearly everything—is the
                advent of artificial intelligence within Oracle Database, the world’s most
                popular data management system.</p>
        </div>
</div>
        <div class="container-right-2-col" >
            <p>The world has depended on Oracle’s flagship database to power critical
                business processes for many years, from creating financial reports to
                running electric grids to automating supply chains. Oracle Database is also
                the foundation of digital business activities such as ecommerce, mobile
                computing, and social media. Data is the unifying thread, the all-pervasive
                fabric for cutting-edge applications in the realms of big data, artificial
                intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT). Now, these mission-critical data
                management systems are gaining a high degree of self-awareness as
                Oracle rolls out the world’s first autonomous database.</p>
            <p>This ebook examines how an intelligent data management cloud can
                transform your IT operation—and your entire business—as the linchpin of a
                larger digital transformation initiative. You’ll learn how Oracle Autonomous
                Database can accelerate your journey to the cloud and simplify your
                IT operation. More specifically, find out how organizations of all sizes
                can boost innovation, minimize costs, and create new business models
                that leverage cloud-based information. Along the way, hear from Oracle
                executives, industry experts, IT consultants, and organizations like yours as
                we illustrate the power and potential of this new incarnation of the world’s
                most popular database.</p>

                <h3>Introducing Oracle Autonomous Database</h3>
                <p>Hailed by Oracle CTO and Chairman Larry Ellison as one of the most
                    important product introductions in Oracle’s history, Oracle Autonomous
                    Database is powered by machine learning technology that enables
                    the database to take care of itself, minimizing human intervention and
                    eliminating manual, error-prone tasks. This self-driving database liberates
                    database administrators (DBAs) from routine maintenance chores and helps
                    to reduce security risks, so they can focus on innovative, high-level work.
                    Adaptive machine learning algorithms automatically patch, tune, back up,
                    and upgrade the system—all the time, while the system is running—ensuring
                    maximum availability.</p>

                <h3>Elasticity for Your Database</h3>
                <p>Amazon may have popularized the concept of infrastructure elasticity with
                    its elastic compute cloud (EC2), but Amazon can’t bring this same degree
                    of elasticity to database workloads. As Andy Mendelsohn, Oracle executive
                    vice president, points out, you can use EC2 to grow and shrink compute
                    resources, but Amazon’s simple, open source databases don’t allow the
                    same degree of elasticity as Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud. “Oracle
                    lets you expand from 8 cores to 16 cores to scale up for an expected surge
                    in ecommerce traffic, or to accommodate the financial close cycle, then
                    back down to 8 cores once activity slows down,” he explains. “Oracle
                    Autonomous Database does this instantly by using Oracle RAC technology
                    to scale the database across clusters of servers very quickly, so there is
                    no need to move data around. Amazon, by contrast, has to move data to
                    bigger systems, a process that can take hours or even days.”</p>

                        <h1>Building on a Rich History of Automation</h1>
                        <p>Oracle has been simplifying the management, tuning, and administration of Oracle Database for decades, and many of the sophisticated technologies designed to streamline activities for DBAs are now fully automated. For example, with Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud, you can deploy a data warehouse in just 15 seconds.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Oracle customer benchmark studies demonstrate performance of up to 14 times faster than Amazon Redshift. Scaling compute or storage resources can be done independently while the database is running. You only pay for what you use, without any delay.</p>
                        <p>Juan Loaiza, Oracle senior vice president, sums up the benefits: “It requires less labor, it is more reliable and secure, and it is much easier for developers to provision a database for analytic or OLTP application workloads,” he says.</p>
                        <p>Database administration is now integrated with complete infrastructure
                            and cloud automation for operations personnel. “Customers can rely on automation and hand over management to Oracle Cloud Operations,” Loaiza adds.</p>

                    <h3 class="cheat-twenty-up">What Is a Self-Driving Database?</h3>
                    <p class="cheat-five-up">Let’s take a closer look at the many ways in which this new database management system eliminates complexity, reduces human error, and alleviates manual management tasks.</p>
                    <h3 class="cheat-five-up">Tunes Itself</h3>
                    <p class="cheat-five-up">Oracle Autonomous Database incorporates machine learning and artificial intelligence to prevent application outages and automate many mundane tasks that are currently handled by database administrators. It builds on years of progress with self-tuning technologies such as Oracle Exadata storage indexes and flash cache, along with powerful query optimization, automatic memory management, and automatic storage management. Now, those advanced capabilities happen as a matter of course. You don’t need to create indexes, partitions, or materialized views to optimize your workload, and all necessary statistics are collected automatically.</p>
                    <h3>Monitors Itself</h3>
                    <p class="cheat-five-up">You’ll never run up against capacity limits or resource bottlenecks within key components such as CPU, storage, and network throughput—all those knobs and dials that formerly had to be tuned and monitored to maintain optimal performance. Now, automatic resource management prevents users and applications from monopolizing resources.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container-right-2-col ">
                    <p>A Cluster Health Monitor uses machine learning algorithms to monitor activity, recognize anomalous events, and take corrective action when necessary. That means you’ll spend less time worrying about keeping your information systems online, optimized, and up to date.</p>

                    <h3 class="top-thirty">Provisions Itself</h3>
                    <p class="cheat-five-up">Traditional database deployments need to provision for the peak possible workload and add a substantial margin of safety on top of that. But peak workloads tend to occur infrequently, leaving most of this costly capacity idle the majority of the time. Oracle Autonomous Database gives you capacity when you need it, and lets you shut it down when you don’t. You simply push a button to provision a mission-critical database, and you only pay for the resources that you use at any given time. It’s a highly efficient model that avoids the burden of having to maintain extra capacity.</p>
                    <p>With Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud, resources can be consumed for the duration of a project, and then be automatically deprovisioned—a highly efficient model that gives you capacity when you need it. You can provision and configure an Oracle Database instance in less than an hour. After that, new database instances can be provisioned in minutes. You simply stipulate how many CPUs you want and how many terabytes of data you would like to provision. Oracle Autonomous Database automatically marshals the necessary hardware and software to create a network for each customer or workgroup.</p>

                    <h3 class="desktop-cheat-twenty-up">Scales Itself</h3>
                    <p>Both computing and storage capacity are instantly elastic. That means you can scale up or down instantly, with no downtime. Independent scaling of compute and storage resources allows you to add or remove CPUs or entire compute nodes and storage servers online—unlike Amazon Web Services, which requires simultaneous scaling of compute and storage capacity. The Oracle system instantly auto-scales itself, eliminating overprovisioning and reducing costs. If you need less, you can scale down or shut down the service to save money—and then restart on demand when necessary.</p>
                    <h3>Secures Itself </h3>
                    <p>With Oracle Autonomous Database, security updates are applied automatically, and data is encrypted automatically—leaving nothing to chance. Native encryption prevents access from outside the database, while Oracle Database Vault prevents administrators from seeing user data and data masking conceals sensitive data from testers. Automated security protects your data from external attacks as well as from malicious internal users. (See <a class="txt-blue underline" onclick=" $('.book-slider').slick('slickGoTo', chapter3);">chapter 3</a> for more information on Oracle database security.)</p>

                <div class="container-right-2-col ">
                    <h3>Optimizes Itself</h3>
                    <p>Oracle automates performance management such as elastic scaling, monitoring, tuning, and optimizing the database. You will no longer waste resources by buying extra servers to accommodate occasional bursts of activity. You can subscribe to the exact amount of resources you need, and never pay for more than you use. That’s the beauty of the cloud, and Oracle’s elastic infrastructure lets you scale up or down at will, matching user demand with a scalable supply. It also automatically diagnoses performance and optimizes itself with tuning automation algorithms, including sophisticated SQL tuning technology to evaluate SQL plans and queries. Automated change management continually assesses changes and upgrades to make sure they don’t adversely impact database workloads.</p>
                    <p>Embedded diagnostic tools handle errors across all layers of the stack. The database collects relevant diagnostic data, uploads information to Oracle support, and runs machine learning algorithms to match known causes to known solutions for rapid resolution. It’s more secure and reliable—and it frees DBAs from generic operational tasks.</p>

                    <p class="cheat-five-up">Today’s enterprise applications work around the clock, yet the vital records they keep are typically backed up only once a day—a risky situation that can result in data loss if there’s an outage or other mishap. It’s an approach that no longer works for the modern enterprise. Who wants to explain to a customer, or the head of finance, that you’ve lost even one bit of their data?</p>
                    <p class="top-twenty">Each night, Oracle Autonomous Database automatically backs up data
                        to Oracle Database Backup Cloud Service, ensuring data safety and availability while delivering cloud-ready scalability. For IT teams, this shift from full backups to continuous data protection eliminates hours of tedious work. Automating essential data protection tasks enables IT pros to focus on other important responsibilities.</p>

                            and ingenuity of today’s cyberattacks. To survive, IT teams must adopt technologies that inherently deliver much higher levels of security than
                            in the past. Granting access to IT resources is rarely a black-and-white decision. Security teams must assess risk continuously to discern between friend and foe. This involves making sense of alerts regarding a huge
                            variety of systems, applications, and datasets—everything from system and application logs, user session activity, and how sensitive IT resources are

An  AI  algorithm  processes  the  data  to  identify  patterns,  create  audit  reports,  and  detect  security  risk  indicators  based  on  predefined  threat  models,  baseline  risk  indicators,  abnormal  events,  and  suspicious  user  activity.  These  automated  capabilities  bring  greater  visibility  and  intelligence  to  cybersecurity  activities.</p>

It can also detect anomalous SQL queries by parsing SQL statements to establish whitelist baselines by user, group, database, and application. It evaluates new SQL queries against this baseline to spot potential threats, raise threat scores, and take action to protect sensitive data.</p>

                        <p class="top-twenty">As manual database management chores become a thing of the past, do DBAs still have an important role to play within the IT enterprise? </p>
                        <p>Penny Avril, vice president of product management for Oracle Database, says the answer is a resounding yes: The database may be minding itself, but somebody still needs to decide which data is mission-critical, which parts of the database must be instantly restored in the event of a mishap, and which users are allowed to see what data. Tomorrow’s database administrators will invariably spend more time on high-level activities including database design, schema design, analytics, and the setting of policies about database use.</p>
                        <p>Think about the “DBA” title without the “B,” Avril suggests. Data administrators and data architects (DAs) aren’t just charged with keeping data in a database. They must also understand the importance of that data to key business stakeholders and are assuming more important roles in driving their businesses forward.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <p>In other words, their jobs are no longer predicated on keeping databases up and running. They are responsible for data modeling, data security, and performance monitoring—essential capabilities that will help them gain greater visibility within the business as their roles grow in importance. “It’s more about managing data, new sources, and new volumes of data and moving away from the mechanics of keeping data alive,” she sums up.</p>
                    <p>Avril offers specific suggestions on how DBAs can prepare themselves for the inevitable transition to the new world of cloud-based, self-managing databases, such as bolstering their skills in the areas of data modeling, performance management, and security configurations. “DBAs have the opportunity to move from being data custodians to taking on a more strategic role in their organizations,” she says.</p>
                    <p>DBAs remain important, but they must embrace a changing role. It begins with understanding the importance of data to key business stakeholders.

It’s easy to migrate existing on-premises data warehouses to the cloud—or create a new data warehouse altogether. Users simply specify tables, load data, and then run their workloads in a matter of seconds. All data is automatically compressed and encrypted. You can take advantage of a wide range of platform services for business intelligence, as well as use Oracle’s cloud-based integration services to accommodate third-party analytics.</p>
